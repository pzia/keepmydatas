Use for personal backup.

This is the simplest way that I have found:

    Install Adobe Digital Editions using winetricks

    winetricks adobe_diged

    Download and install ePUBee within the same wine prefix used by Adobe Digital Editions

    $ cd ~/Downloads
    $ wget http://download.epubee.com/ePUBeeePUBDRMRemoval.exe
    $ WINEPREFIX=~/.local/share/wineprefixes/adobe_diged/ wine ePUBeeePUBDRMRemoval.exe

    Start Adobe Digital Editions and login to your adobe account
    Add your DRM'ed books and wait until they are readable (decrypted)
    Run ePUBee. It should automatically decrypt any files added to Adobe Digital Editions to

    ~/.local/share/wineprefixes/adobe_diged/drive_c/users/${USER}/Application\ Data/decrypt/
